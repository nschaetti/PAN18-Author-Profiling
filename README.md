-----------------------------------------------------

Author Profiling Challenge of the PAN @ CLEF 2018

This repository consists of:

* find_alpha.py : Test various values for the leak parameter between image and tweet prediction.
* main.py : Use the model to predict the gender of Twitter profiles contained in a dataset.
* single_model_image.py : Train various image classification model for gender profiling.
* single_model_tweet.py : Train various tweet classification model for gender profiling.

PAN@CLEF18 Author profiling challenge
=====================================

```
Authorship analysis deals with the classification of texts into classes based on the stylistic choices of their authors. Beyond the author identification and author verification tasks where the style of individual authors is examined, author profiling distinguishes between classes of authors studying their sociolect aspect, that is, how language is shared by people. This helps in identifying profiling aspects such as gender, age, native language, or personality type. Author profiling is a problem of growing importance in applications in forensics, security, and marketing. E.g., from a forensic linguistics perspective one would like being able to know the linguistic profile of the author of a harassing text message (language used by a certain type of people) and identify certain characteristics (language as evidence). Similarly, from a marketing viewpoint, companies may be interested in knowing, on the basis of the analysis of blogs and online product reviews, the demographics of people that like or dislike their products. The focus is on author profiling in social media since we are mainly interested in everyday language and how it reflects basic social and personality processes.
